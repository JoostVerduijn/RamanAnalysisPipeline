# Raman Analysis Pipeline (RAP)

## Overview
This repository sets out the skeleton of an organizational structure used for scientific research. It loosely follows what I have used for several of my research projects and I hope it inspires you to conduct your research in an open, reproducible, and honest manner.

## Layout

The repository is split into seven main directories, many of which have subdirectories. This structure has been designed to be easily navigable by humans and computers alike, allowing for rapid location of specific files and instructions. Within each directory is a `README.md` file which summarizes the purpose of that directory as well as some examples where necessary. This structure may not be perfect for your intended us and may need to be modified. Each section is briefly described below. 

### **`Data Raman scans`** 
Folder containing all raw data from Raman scans as a .spc file. Each folder is a biological replicate, which each .spc being a different cell. Size of a Large Area Scan (LAS) are given in the file names name.

### **`Analysis in R`** 
Contains all R-scripts used for data analysis, feel free to utilize and improve upon.

1. **`LICENSE`**: A legal protection of your work. *It is important to think deeply about the licensing of your work, and is not a decision to be made lightly. See [this useful site](https://choosealicense.com/) for more information about licensing and choosing the correct license for your project.*

2. **`README.md`**: A descriptive yet succinct description of your research project and information regarding the structure outlined below.
